# CVEs PoCs

This repository contains **research-driven Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementations** for recently disclosed CVEs across **web applications and native binaries**.

The goal is to demonstrate **vulnerability discovery, root-cause analysis, exploitation paths, and defensive considerations**, rather than weaponization.

## Scope
- Web vulnerabilities (auth bypass, deserialization, injection, logic flaws)
- Binary vulnerabilities (memory corruption, logic errors, unsafe parsing)
- Static and dynamic analysis–driven research
- Exploitation validation and security impact analysis

## Research Approach
Each CVE PoC focuses on:
- Understanding the vulnerable code path
- Reproducing the issue in a controlled environment
- Demonstrating exploitability or security impact
- Documenting mitigations and defensive lessons

## Disclaimer
All content is provided **strictly for educational, research, and defensive purposes**.  
Do not use these PoCs against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
